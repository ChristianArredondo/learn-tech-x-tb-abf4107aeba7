Sample flow for making changes and submitting a PR after getting the app up and running.
```
// check out a new branch for your changes
git checkout -b {BRANCH_NAME}

// make changes and commit them
git add --all
git commit

// push new branch up to GitHub
git push origin {BRANCH_NAME}

// use GitHub to make PR
```
